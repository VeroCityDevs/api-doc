# Internet of Things


Powerful and well structured environment based on FIWARE NGSI v2 that supports fast and scalable connections of things to the Internet which allows you to create and manage networks of things, monitor and publish historical and context data, define rules to trigger events and automated actions. This solution is built on the concepts of FI-Guardian project.


- Create network of things connecting devices and sensors
- Design and implement rules of action management from jobs, triggers, functions and subscriptions
- Create custom iot dashboards to monitor your networks of things in real-time
- Create layers of iot networks and apply them to maps
- Use our libraries and apis to make easier and faster the deployment of specialized applications
- Automate processes to improve operational efficiency
- Analyse your data and get insights to take smarter actions and improve business processes
- Publish iot data on thematic channels of content and services



## What will be possible to do with the IOT api?
- Go deep into the `Data Model` mechanism, understanding the data modeling of all available IoT entities.
- Consume the context-aware data from the Orion Context Broker.
- List all Networks and their branches and all linked entities.
- Perform geographical queries and get the context-aware converted into geoJson
- Access the historical data and request an export to CSV file.
