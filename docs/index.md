# WELCOME TO WE4CITY API DOCUMENTATION
This document will guide you to consume our Platform API endpoints. Using the Platform API, you are able to access public information stored in a Data Lake that combine many Fiware Technologies.

## Technology 
Designed with a FIWARE based reasoning, the solution was created by [VM9](http://vm9it.com/) from the award-winning FI-GUARDIAN app and is being evolved since 2014. The platform uses, on its core, Orion, CEP, CKAN, KnowAge, GeoServer and IDAS backend GEs with different IoT Agents allowing multiple device composition through the IoT Broker in a combined way.

Our platform integrates several technologies such as IoT, GIS, eGov, Open Data, Data Analytics and BI, aligned to the Data Economy concepts, enabling the cross-sector resource interchange with responsive web interface.



## About our platform
We4city is a technology solutions platform for Smart Cities, based on open standards and artificial intelligence, which provides integrated support for the Internet of Things (IoT), Real Time Cameras, Geographic Information Systems, Virtual Assistants, Big Data and Open Data, among others.
From the Data Lakes concept, the solution allows you to integrate data silos and produce the most important fuel for Smart Cities: Urban Intelligence.
All this means more practicality and dynamism for society and more efficiency for public institutions.
